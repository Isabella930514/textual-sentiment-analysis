N1	Dine-in reserved seats near the windows were excellent. Recommended dishes ordered were tasty and the unlimited rice was a bonus. Service was quick and staff were accommodating and friendly. I would be back for more menu offerings.
N2	Very authentic Thai food. Curry is recommended, with a strong coconut milk flavor.
N3	I don't like the dishes, it is disgusting.
N4	Absolutely amazing food, and great service considering how busy it was! Atmosphere was relaxed. Nice and clean environment.
N5	Nice service, most of the food are tasty. BUT I have to say I am very worried about the undercooked scallop. The first one I had was cold on one side and warm on the other side, the second one is warm But raw and soft inside. I am not sure they are fresh or frozen, But I am pretty sure that it should not taste like that.
N6	Terrible pineapple fried rice and Tom yum soup. Tasted like someone dunked 1/2 cup of sugar in each. Pineapple fried rice didnâ€™t taste at all like the authentic version.
